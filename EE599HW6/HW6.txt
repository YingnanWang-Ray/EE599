Question 3
It should be O(n^2).

Question 4
It should be O(n^2). 

Question 5
I used the recursive method. If the maze is N*N. The best condition is O(N). 

Question 6
O(n).
I compare all the elements with the element we want to compare. The elements greater than this will push into vector part2. Otherwise the elements less than this will push into vector part1. 
And I merge part1, part2 and the compare number together.
